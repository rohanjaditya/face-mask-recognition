# face-mask-recognition

This project was submitted as part of the coursework for CS677 - Data Science with Python during the Fall 2021 semester at Boston University.

The objective of this project is to classify faces into one of three categories:
1. Wearing a mask
2. Not wearing a mask
3. Incorrectly wearing a mask

The results of two different methods of resizing the images are also examined. 

Since the number of training samples is low, data augmentation is also applied.
Finally, several validation metrics are used to assess each of the models.
